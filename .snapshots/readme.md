# Code Snapshots Directory

## Overview

This directory serves as a centralized repository for code snapshots generated during AI-assisted development sessions. Each snapshot captures the current state of the codebase, providing essential context for AI interactions and maintaining a historical record of development progress.

## Purpose

The snapshots directory is designed to:

- **Facilitate AI Development**: Provide comprehensive context to AI assistants for more accurate code suggestions and problem-solving
- **Maintain Development History**: Keep a record of code states at various development milestones
- **Enable Context Sharing**: Allow seamless sharing of project context across different development sessions
- **Support Debugging**: Preserve code states for troubleshooting and regression analysis

## Snapshot Contents

Each snapshot typically includes:

### Code Files
- **Source Files**: Selected JavaScript/TypeScript components, utilities, and configuration files
- **Style Files**: CSS, SCSS, or Tailwind configuration files relevant to the current development context
- **Configuration Files**: Package.json, environment configurations, and build settings

### Project Metadata
- **Project Structure**: Directory tree and file organization
- **Dependencies**: Current package versions and dependency graph
- **Build Information**: Compilation status and build configurations

### Development Context
- **User Prompts**: Original questions or requests that initiated the AI interaction
- **Problem Statements**: Specific issues being addressed or features being implemented
- **Development Goals**: Objectives and expected outcomes for the current session

## File Format

Snapshots are stored as Markdown files (`.md`) with the following structure:

```markdown
# Snapshot: [Timestamp/Description]

## Context
[Description of the development context]

## Code Files
[Relevant code snippets and file contents]

## Project Structure
[Directory tree and organization]

## Prompt/Question
[User's original request or question]
```

## Configuration

Snapshot behavior can be customized through the `config.json` file in this directory. Available options include:

- **Inclusion Rules**: Define which files and directories to include in snapshots
- **Exclusion Patterns**: Specify files or patterns to exclude (e.g., node_modules, build artifacts)
- **Snapshot Frequency**: Configure automatic snapshot generation intervals
- **Retention Policy**: Set how long snapshots should be preserved

## Best Practices

### For Developers
- **Regular Snapshots**: Create snapshots at significant development milestones
- **Descriptive Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for snapshot files
- **Context Documentation**: Include sufficient context in prompts and descriptions
- **Cleanup**: Periodically review and remove outdated snapshots

### For AI Interactions
- **Comprehensive Context**: Ensure snapshots include all relevant code and configuration
- **Current State**: Verify snapshots reflect the most recent code changes
- **Problem Clarity**: Clearly articulate the issue or feature request in prompts

## Security Considerations

- **Sensitive Data**: Ensure snapshots do not contain API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information
- **Environment Variables**: Exclude or redact environment-specific configurations
- **Production Data**: Never include production database contents or user data

## Maintenance

This directory should be:
- **Regularly Reviewed**: Periodically assess snapshot relevance and remove outdated files
- **Version Controlled**: Include in git repository for team collaboration (excluding sensitive data)
- **Documented**: Maintain clear documentation of snapshot purposes and contexts
